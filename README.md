## Features

- Extract metadata from academic papers
- Support for multiple sources:
  - arXiv papers
  - IACR ePrints
  - DOI-based papers
- Handle both URLs and direct identifiers

## ðŸ“¦ Installation 

Add this to your `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies]
learner = "0.1.0"
```

## Quick Start

```rust
use learner::Paper;

#[tokio::main]
async fn main() {
    // From arXiv URL
    let paper = Paper::new("https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.07041").await?;
    println!("Title: {}", paper.title);
    
    // From arXiv ID
    let paper = Paper::new("2301.07041").await?;
}
```

> **Note**
> The `Paper::new()` method automatically detects the source type from the input string, handling both URLs and direct identifiers.

## Roadmap

### Phase 1: Core Functionality
- PDF content extraction
- Local database for paper management
- Filesystem daemon for monitoring new papers
- REST API for paper submission and retrieval

> **Warning**
> The PDF extraction feature is experimental and may not work with all paper formats.

### Phase 2: Advanced Features
- LLM-powered paper analysis and summarization
- RSS feed integration for automated paper discovery
- Citation graph analysis
- Automatic tagging and categorization
